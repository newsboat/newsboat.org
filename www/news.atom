            <p>
                The new key-binding system mentioned in the previous entry is
                finally here! After years of work, done primarily by Dennis van
                der Schagt, we now have a <code>bind</code> command that:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        can create multi-key bindings, i.e. one can bind not
                        just single letters (with Control or Shift), but also
                        sequences of letters (each with their own modifiers);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allows each binding to execute multiple actions, just
                        like our existing <code>macro</code> command. Unlike macros,
                        <code>bind</code> doesn't require a "macro prefix",
                            so one can finally bind a sequence of operations
                            to a <emph>single</emph> key;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allows adding documentation strings to each binding,
                        which are then shown in the help dialog. This again is
                        an improvement upon macros, which had no descriptions and
                        didn't have a way for the user to provide their own;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        adds alternative syntax for keys. Instead of the usual
                        <code>^R</code> syntax, one can now use
                        <code>&lt;C-r&gt;</code> a la Tmux or Emacs. Hopefully
                        this makes multi-key bindings easier to read.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The feature is very new, and probably contains bugs. Please
                report them! In fact, it's so new that we didn't have time to
                finish the corresponding <code>unbind</code> command LOL.
                However, since Newsboat doesn't have any multi-key bindings
                by default, <code>unbind</code> was deemed to not be a release blocker.
            </p>

            <p>
                The new feature also has a limitation in that multi-key bindings
                that have the same prefix must have the same length. In other
                words, it's fine to have <code>abc</code> and <code>abx</code>
                bound simultaneously, but it's not possible to bind both
                <code>ab</code> and <code>abc</code> at the same time.
                This is to avoid an ambiguity when the prefix is typed;
                in that case Newsboat would have to decide somehow
                if the next key is going to be <code>c</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are all very proud of this feature, and eagerly awaiting your
                feedback! Please try it, and open an issue if something doesn't
                work or could be improved.
            </p>

            <p>
                One more thing: we now require a compiler that accepts
                <code>-std=c++17</code> flag. In other words, we dropped Clang 4
                support. This is due to libicu 75 requiring C++17; we depend on
                this library via libxml2, and the requirement bleeds through to
                us because we're indirectly including some of libicu header files.
            </p>

            <p>
                Compilers without C++17 support are now considered deprecated.
                Future Newsboat releases will probably use some of C++17 features,
                at which point we'll drop support. If that's going to create
                problems for you, please file an issue.

            <p>
                This release brings a few bug fixes, most notable of which is the
                <code>cookie-cache</code> setting; it used to be broken for
                <code>reload-all</code> and <code>auto-reload</code>, but no more.
                There are also a couple improvements for Miniflux, as well as
                various little tweaks here and there. More details in
                <a href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#238---2024-12-22">the changelog</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from user-visible changes, there are also ongoing work
                on the internals. We're progressing towards new key-binding system
                which should allow multi-key bindings and unify keys with macros.
                We're also halfway through improving how Newsboat handles file paths;
                once complete, this should enable us to properly fix the Rust-related
                crashes that some users are experiencing right now.
            </p>

            <p>
                Merry Christmas, and a happy New Year!

        <title>Newsboat 2.37 is out, along with bugfix releases for 2.19 through 2.36</title>

            <p>
                Since 2.19, Newsboat treated HTTP code 304 (Not Modified) as
                error, and retried the download up to the limit specified by
                `download-retries`. The default for that setting is 1, so no
                harm done, but if the user changed it, Newsboat turned into a
                request-spamming machine.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today’s release fixes that. We’re also making point releases for
                everything starting from 2.19 all the way up to the previous
                release, 2.36. If you can upgrade to 2.37, great. If you can't,
                please, <i>please</i> upgrade to the closest point release you can.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a bunch of other fixes and improvements in 2.37 as
                well, but they’re less important, so find them in the changelog.

		When I forked Newsbeuter, I decided I‘d make releases every
		three months. My reasoning was pragmatic: I didn‘t want to ever
		ask myself “is this enough changes to make a new release”. That
		approach worked great so far, but occasionally it results in
		tiny releases like the one we have today.
            </p>

            <p>
                There‘s really nothing exciting to say about 2.36, so just upgrade:

            <p>
                Another quarter, another Newsboat release!
            </p>

            <p>
		The highlight for this one is Feedbin support. Feedbin is an
		online newsreading service in the vein of Google Reader, and we
		already support a bunch of similar ones. The feature request
                for Feedbin specifically was filed 4 years ago, and upvoted
		19 times — twice more often than the runner-up, a request for
		separators between groups of feeds. We‘ve been waiting for an
		interested person to tackle this, and finally James Vaughan
                showed up with a complete implementation. Please give it a spin
		if you‘ve been waiting for this functionality all these years,
                and thanks for your patience!
            </p>

            <p>
		Another notable feature is support for item starring with
		Miniflux. This was on the to-do list for a while too, and was
		implemented by gilcu3. Interestingly, both of these are first
		ever contributions; it‘s very nice to see new faces in
                Newsboat‘s pull requests!
            </p>

            <p>
		There‘s also a few new scripts in the contrib directory, and
		loads of internal reworking by Dennis van der Schagt and others.
		Probably some new bugs too, but Juho Eerola fixed one in 2.35,
                so let‘s call it even, ok?
            </p>

            <p>
                Here‘s a little update to your favourite RSS/Atom reader,
                everyone :)
            </p>

            <p>
                There aren‘t many user-visible changes though; most of the
                effort was spent improving things internally. Dennis van der
                Schagt and bogdasar1985 continue to make progress on various
                fronts, which should eventually bring us a new key-bind system,
                help fix the long-standing issue with non-UTF-8 content in old
                cache.db files, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Docs also received some updates and polish. Lysander Trischler
                continues to play a vital role here, reviewing all the
                docs-related changes and helping authors improve them even
                further. Incidentally, I don‘t mention any of this work in the
                changelog; should I?
            </p>

            <p>
                Hope you‘ll find this new release at least as good as the
                previous one. We‘re already working on the next, better one :)
                Merry Christmas to those who celebrate today, and a happy New
                Year!
            </p>

	<p>It’s my pleasure to announce a new release of Newsboat, the feed
	reader for the text console. This new version includes a couple notable
	changes:

	<ul>
	<li>much faster navigation in large feeds, thanks to the excellent work
	done by Dennis van der Schagt;</li>

	<li>items in feeds produced by Mastodon now have proper titles rather
	than a bunch of numbers, and the attached image is displayed inline
	rather than being lost entirely. This again thanks to Dennis van der
	Schagt and also Martin Vilcans.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>There are a few smaller fixes too, which you can discover by
	yourself by downloading a fresh tarball from the links below ;)

        <p>It’s the end of June, and so we have another release! As usual of
        late, it’s rather small. The most noticeable addition is probably the
        new option, <code>--export-to-opml2</code>, which finally allows to
        export feed URLs <i>along with their tags</i>. There was also a bit of
        work on the existing facilities, like the behaviour of
        <code>goto-feed</code> operation and Newsboat’s support for enclosures
        in Mastodon feeds; please
        <a href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#232---2023-06-25">see the changelog</a>
        for the full list.</p>

        <p>I (Alexander Batischev) was again pretty much absent from the
        development, but I feel like the break did me some good, and I’m
        enthusiastic about getting back into the thick of things. I’m also very
        happy to see that the project didn’t simply grind to a halt when
        I stepped back. To me, this indicates that we’re in a better position
        than Newsbeuter ever was, which is nice because it was one of the goals
        of this fork. Still have ways to improve of course :)</p>

        <p>Anyway, enough of this navel-gazing! Go compile something from
        <a href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.32/newsboat-2.32.tar.xz">the tarball</a>
        (checking
        <a href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.32/newsboat-2.32.tar.xz.asc">its signature</a>
        beforehand, of course), glance through
        <a href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.32/docs/newsboat.html">the docs</a>
        (or maybe don’t — they didn’t change :), and see if anything in
        <a href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#232---2023-06-25">the changelog</a>
        affects your workflow.</p>

		<p>This release fixes build failure with curl 7.87. It only just 
		came out, so this shouldn’t affect many people right now, but I 
		decided to make a patch release anyway, because disros are bound 
		to pick up 7.87 before the next Newsboat release.</p>

		<p>For once, the development cycle was so quiet that I can 
		enumerate all the noteworthy changes in this release. They 
		are:</p>

		<p><b>Ability to go back to previous set of search results.</b> 
		We’ve all been there: searched for something, then searched 
		again with a more specific query, refined it once more, but then 
		we made a typo or picked wrong words — and bam, the results 
		we’re looking at aren’t what we wanted to see. Before 2.28, 
		the only recourse was to start the process anew. With 2.28, all 
		one has to do is press <i>z</i>, which will bring back the 
		previous results. Pressing it once more will of course go further 
		back, until we’re at the very first set of results again. This 
		change is accompanied by a new placeholder for 
		<code>searchresult-title-format<code> setting, <code>%s</code>, 
		which is replaced by the current search term; you won’t get 
		lost in the searches, promise!</p>

		<p><b>Enqueueing podcasts straight from the article list.</b> 
		Such a simple feature, yet it took <i>this</i> long to notice 
		that it’s missing. As a bonus, <code>articlelist-format</code> 
		now supports <code>%e</code> placeholder which is replaced by the 
		URL of the enclosure; that way, you can see what you’re going 
		to enqueue.</p>

		<p><b>If an article has multiple links, 
		<code>open-in-browser</code> will open the HTTP(S) one.</b> This 
		is about the link you see at the top of the article, prefixed by 
		"Link:". The standards allow an article to have multiple such 
		links, but Newsboat only supports one, and it now tries to pick 
		more intelligently. If the article doesn’t specify any HTTP(S) 
		links, the last one to appear in the source code will be 
		picked.</p>

		<p>That’s it for now. Please download Newsboat 2.28 from the usual place:

            <p>One more slow, quiet development cycle is past us.</p>

            <p>We’ve added just one new feature: <code>ignore-article</code>
            can now be applied to feeds that match a particular regular
            expression. This should help you DRY your configs, or improve
            performance if you were already doing something like <code>feedurl
            =~ "https://example.com/feed/.*"</code>.</p>

            <p>Another highlight &mdash;a literal highlight&mdash; of this
            release are our manpages. We added some formatting (bold font and
            underlining) to make the settings and options easier to spot.
            Hopefully this improves the readibility and makes the manpages even
            more useful!</p>

            <p>Oh, and we also fixed some bugs. Please see the changelog for
            details on that.</p>

            <p>That’s about it. Go get 2.27 now:

	    <p>This development cycle was even quieter than the previous one.
	    We added a new setting, <code> confirm-mark-feed-read </code>,
	    to prevent users from accidentally marking an entire feed as read.
	    Search results no longer show ignored articles (d’oh!) We’ve taken
	    away ability to switch away from file- and dirbrowser, which closes

            <p>The last three months felt pretty quiet, especially towards the
            end of the cycle, but we still got quite a few things done. The
            most noticeable of them is the UI change: the keymap hints at the
            bottom of the screen now use more colours and formatting, making
            the entire line easier to read.</p>

            <p>We also fixed three crashes and two performance regressions, so
            that’s good too.</p>

            <p>Not a groundbreaking release by any means, but it’s still worth
            upgrading I think :)</p>

            <p>Another three months went by, so here's a new release! The pace
            we picked up last year slowly dissipates, so 2.24 is more like 2.23
            than, say, 2.20. Still, this is a pretty interesting release: we
            added a way to document macros, implemented support for plaintext
            entries —you'll love this one if you read antirez' or YouTube's
            feeds!— and added support for FreshRSS. Plus a usual crop of bug
            fixes, of course. Check it out!</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>

            <p>You might’ve heard of the drama around Freenode, the IRC
            network. <a href="https://kline.sh">Their volunteer staff quit</a>,
            and the new-ish management started making really weird moves (see
            <a href="https://github.com/freenode/web-7.0/pull/513">here</a> and
            <a href=" https://www.devever.net/~hl/freenode_abuse">here</a>). For
            the past week, we on #newsboat were <a
            href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues/1643">discussing
            where to move</a>. The deadline was set to June 5th, but today, our
            hand was forced: Freenode revoked my access to the channel, muted
            everyone in it, and changed the topic to suggest using ##newsboat
            instead. Presumably, this is a reaction to us considering the
            move.</p>

            <p>Luckily the decision was all but sealed at that point: half our
            IRC users were already on Libera.Chat, and there was no votes
            against moving there entirely. Libera currently lacks a Matrix
            bridge and a webchat, but those things are being worked on, and
            aren’t blockers in the long run.</p>

            <p>Please update your mental bookmarks: next time you want to chat,
            join #newsboat on <a
            href="https://libera.chat">irc.libera.chat</a>. See you there!</p>

            <p>This little release fixes a couple regressions in 2.22:</p>

            <ol>

            <li>slow scrolling in the article list;</li>

            <li>segfaults if <code>swap-title-and-hints</code> is enabled;</li>

            <li>build failure on GCC 9 due to <code>maybe-uninitialized</code>
                warning which <code>-Werror</code> turns into an error.</li>

            </ol>

            <p>Sorry about those. Apparently our <code>master</code> branch
            doesn’t get enough testing, so if you can run a version built from
            Git and report problems early, please do!</p>

            <p>Another Christmas, another Newsboat release! Hope you're used to
            these by now, because we don't intend to stop shipping
            them&nbsp;:)</p>

            <p>You all deserve a present, and Newsboat 2.22 contains two! One,
            it finally learned to ask you for confirmation before marking all
            feeds as read. No more data loss! (But please make backups anyway.)
            Another, is a bugfix that should make the infamous "an instance is
            already running, PID 0" error go away. It's replaced by another
            error *sigh*, but that one is more descriptive at least.</p>

            <p>Aside from that, this release contains a bunch of smaller, but
            still very nice, features and bug fixes, so please take a look at
            the changelog, and then take the new version for a spin!</p>

            <p>Today is Newsboat’s third birthday, and it caught me by
            surprise. Mainly because our GPG key stopped working (it expired),
            but also because it doesn’t actually feel like three years to
            me.</p>

            <p>It feels way less than that. Three years is a lot of time, yet
            I didn’t manage to grok all the corners of the codebase. I also
            didn’t make any architectural changes (except for starting the Rust
            porting, perhaps — by the way, that effort has been going for two
            years now!). Even after three years of doing this, it feels like
            I’m just getting started.</p>

            <p>It also feels far longer than that. Multiple high-volume
            contributors came and went, each marking an era of sorts. A total
            of 78 people submitted pull requests, a few emailed patches. Many
            more reported bugs, discussed new features, described their
            use-cases. I remember many of those interactions, and it feels
            surprising that we fit all of them into just three years.</p>

            <p>Even just looking at 2.21’s changelog, I am taken aback by the
            amount of stuff that we managed to accomplish over the last three
            months. And the changelog doesn’t even tell the whole story, as we
            also did quite a lot of refactoring.</p>

            <p>It’s as good a time as any to say thank you. Thanks to all the
            users who run Newsboat, report bugs, and help us with debugging and
            testing. Thanks to all the developers who fix and improve things,
            and spend time addressing all my nitpicks during code review. The
            project wouldn’t be here without all of you! (That’s a cliche thing
            to say, but it is actually true: just look how many bugs
            contributors fix, and notice that my commit activity is correlated
            with other’s work).</p>

            <p>Okay, enough of my rambling. Go get yourself a shiny new feed
            reader:
            <a href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.21/newsboat-2.21.tar.xz">the tarball</a>,

            Oh, and do fetch an updated GPG key 4ED6CD61932B9EBE; I bumped the
            expiry date by a year.</p>

            <p>Newsboat 2.20 was our most broken release so far. It introduced
                <i>four</i> regressions:</p>

            <ol>
            <li><code>make install</code> was broken on BSDs because we used
                a GNU-only flag;</li>

            <li>it unintentionally started requiring a space before the
                semicolon in macros;</li>

            <li>it could segfault upon startup under certain conditions;</li>

            <li>in Spanish locale, feeds couldn't be sorted via <code>g</code>
                and <code>G</code> keys.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These are all fixed by this release, so please upgrade.</p>

            <p>We added more tests now, so the first two bugs won't happen
                again. But the other two can only be caught by vigilant users
                for now, so if you can, please build directly from Git and
                report everything that's broken.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your patience with us even as we break something
                every other release!</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, hope you’re all doing well.</p>

            <p>We didn’t set out to make it like that, but the new release is
            balanced in every way. There are as many visible changes as
            behind-the-scenes refactorings, and the visible changes are split
            evenly between bugfixes, improvements, and new features. I’m happy
            to report that, despite the current world situation, Newsboat’s
            development chugs along as usual.</p>

            <p>Your regularly scheduled Newsboat release is on the dot!</p>

            <p>Code-wise, this is a pretty uneventful one. Most of the work
                was related to upkeep — slight refactorings, fixes, tweaks to
                the infrastructure. But we did manage to squeeze a couple
                bugfixes in there, too: <code>unbind-key -a</code> no longer
                breaks command line, and Newsboat no longer ignores browser’s
                exit code when marking article as read.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most user-visible change this time around is the
                logo. That’s right: a user by the name of noobilanderi sat down
                with Inkscape and drew us <a
                href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/blob/master/logo.svg">a
                logo</a>. This is now used everywhere: site’s favicon, GitHub

            <p>Within days of 2.17 release, we got reports of two regressions.</p>

            <p>Users who set <code>max-items</code> (to limit the number of
                articles that Newsboat stores) found that no feeds are updated
                anymore. That was an unintended consequence of the “slight
                performance improvement” I mentioned in the previous entry;
                I thought Newsboat is doing useless work, when in fact that
                work was necessary for the <code>max-items</code> setting to
                function properly. The “improvement” was partially
                reverted to amend this.</p>

            <p>The second, no less severe, regression prevented Newsboat from
                loading configs that used <code>#</code> character for anything
                but comments, e.g. as part of a regular expression for
                <code>highlight-article</code>. This was a result of another
                bugfix, where I failed to consider if the hash sign can occur
                in the middle of a config string. We couldn’t simply revert
                this one, so I implemented yet another bugfix, that hopefully
                squashes both the original bug and the regression, while not
                introducing any new ones.</p>

            <p>Sorry about the mess. Please download the bugfix release from out site: <a

            <p>With this release, Newsboat gained a new feature: you can now
                save <i>all</i> the articles in the feed to text files, by
                invoking <code>save-all</code> operation (it’s not bound to any
                key by default). There’s also a few bug fixes, and even
                a slight performance improvement.</p>

            <p>The codebase is now 18.7% Rust (according to GitHub). I think we
                picked most of the low-hanging fruit by now. I expect the
                rewrite to progress more slowly from here on, as we need to
                untangle dependencies between sub-systems.</p>

            <p>We don’t have continuous integration for FreeBSD and/or i386, so
                we were absolutely oblivious to the fact that Newsboat couldn’t
                be built on those for over a month now. Luckily for us, Tobias
                Kortkamp already figured out the fixes, which we release now;
                thanks, mate!</p>

            <p>The very next thing I’m going to do is finally set up a CI for
                FreeBSD, and see if i386 can be added to Travis pipeline.</p>

            <p>I’m sorry about the mess and the noise, folks. Won’t make this
                particular mistake again.</p>

            <p>Another quarter, another release! We fixed a couple of bugs, and
                got a few user-contributed colorschemes and scripts.</p>

            <p>But the bulk of the work is under the hood. Newsboat is now
                13.4% Rust (by GitHub's count), which is almost double compared
                to the previous release. If we sustain the 6.5%-per-release
                momentum, the rewrite will be done in three and a half
                years—without any loss of functionality, but with a lot more
                bugs fixed.</p>

            <p>It’s second-to-last weekend of March, so it’s time for a new
                release. Please welcome Newsboat 2.15!</p>

            <p>2.14.1 was released just over a month ago, and stole many of the
                features meant for 2.15. As a result, this release is quite
                slim. The only new features are a way to shuffle a feed, and
                “delete all items” that now works in query feeds. The rest is
                the usual crop of bugfixes.</p>

            <p>The Rust rewrite is progressing slowly but steadily. This
                release could be bigger have I not chosen to hold off a big
                chunk of code that hasn’t been field-tested yet. (Believe it or
                not, we <b>do</b> test some of the stuff before the
                release). If GitHub is to be believed, 6.9% of our code is now
                in Rust.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey there,</p>

            <p>Turns out Newsboat 2.14.1 fails to build with Rust 1.25.
                That's the oldest Rust release we support; it was published at
                the end of March 2018. Rust 1.26 and newer work fine.</p>

            <p>This is entirely my fault: I bumped our crates' versions without
                updating the Cargo.lock. Rust 1.25 trusts the lock file blindly,
                and fails when it can't find the old crate versions specified there.</p>

            <p>The problem has been fixed in the master branch. See
                <a href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/commit/cbad27a19d270f2f0fce9317651e2c9f0aa22865.patch">this
                patch</a>. You can generate a more conservative version (that
                doesn't update third-party crates) with <code>cargo update
                --package libnewsboat --package libnewsboat-ffi</code>.</p>

            <p>With just one compiler version affected, I don't feel this is
                important enough for another point release, so I won't be
                issuing any.</p>

            <p>If this inconveniences you in any way, I'd like to hear from
                you! I'm genuinely interested in how old a Rust compiler I
                should support. I arrived at 1.25 lower bound in a totally
                unsystematic way: picked what Debian stable had, then bumped
                one version up because of some crate I added as a dependency.
                Please <a href="https://newsboat.org/">get in touch</a> if
                you're using anything older than latest stable.</p>

        <title>Newsboat 2.13 is out</title>
        <link href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.13/docs/newsboat.html" />
        <id>https://newsboat.org/releases/2.13/docs/newsboat.html</id>

        <updated>2018-09-22T20:00:00Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[
            <p>The 2.13 release is special in two ways.</p>

            <p>First of all, it marks an anniversary: exactly a year ago, we
            forked from Newsbeuter to bring the program back into shape. We
            partially succeeded: many bugs were fixed, a number of rough
            corners were smoothed, and the atmosphere around the project
            improved noticeably.</p>

            <p>Second, this release is going to be the last purely-C++ one. As
            I explain in <a
            href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues/89">#89</a>,
            I believe that C++ is a death by a thousand cuts for this project.
            This discourages me from working on it. It’s as much a personal
            problem as it is technical one, and I’m absolutely <i>not</i> sure
            that I’m doing the right thing, but: I’m rewriting Newsboat in
            Rust.</p>

            <p>In the short term, this means we will be introducing bugs
            instead of fixing them, and features will be much harder to add
            while we’re moving. Please bear with us!</p>

            <p>Package maintainers will have to spend time figuring out how to
            package Newsboat now. I’m sorry about that. If you’re a maintainer,
            and you run into <i>any</i> problems, please get in touch via <a
            href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues">the issue
            tracker</a>, <a
            href="http://groups.google.com/group/newsboat">mailing list</a>
            (newsboat@googlegroups.com), or IRC (#newsboat on Freenode). I want
            to fix or forestall any problems upstream, so you don’t have to
            suffer as much.</p>

            <p>Despite all this, I believe that long-term benefits outweigh any
            temporary discomfort. A rewrite should straighten out a few of the
            nastier corners of the codebase, and put us in a better position to
            actually evolve the project.</p>

            <p>If you’re interested in helping out, please <a
            href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat">watch the project on
            GitHub</a>; soon, I will be opening issues about components that
            can be rewritten. I can provide guidance around our codebase, plus
            some general mentoring (I’m not ready to teach Rust, since I’m
            still learning it myself, but I’ll share what I know). In short, if
            you know a bit of Rust and can read C++, you’re qualified; please
            come!</p>

            <p>In the meantime, you’ll probably need a feed reader; you can get
            one here: <a
            href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.13/newsboat-2.13.tar.xz">the

            <p>The new release is on the dot! Three-month cadence works great
                so far, so I plan to stick to it.</p>
            <p>This release contains <i>less</i> new stuff than the previous
                one, but I still decided to bump the minor version because we
                have new features. Should’ve done this with 2.10.2 too, but oh
                well—what’s done is done.</p>
            <p>As usual, <a
                    href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.11/newsboat-2.11.tar.xz">
                    the tarball</a> and <a
                    href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.11/newsboat-2.11.tar.xz.asc">
                    its signature</a>
                can be found on our server, and
                <a href="https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#211---2018-03-25">
                the full changelog</a> is on GitHub.</p>
            <p>Happy newsreading!</p>
            <p><b>Addendum</b>: I messed up during the release process and
                pushed a Git tag pointing to an earlier version. If you updated
                your Newsboat clone in the last 30 minutes, please do the
                following:
<pre>
$ git tag --delete r2.11
$ git fetch origin tag r2.11
$ git rev-parse r2.11
</pre>
            </p>
                     
            <p>That last command should return
                971fe6a596d871073ff34c42854e2c9f50e683ba. Sorry about the
                noise, folks!</p>

            <p>Mere three months after our previous release, I present to you
                Newsboat 2.10.2! As you can tell, this is a minor release,
                but it still includes nice things like support for Inoreader,
                correct wrapping for CJK languages, and a translation to Slovak.</p>

            <p>As Russian saying goes, “the first pancake is always lumpy”.
                Newsboat 2.10 was released rather hastily and was just a tad
                undertested and underbaked. Newsboat 2.10.1 amends this by:
                <ul><li>documentating automatic migration that was added in
                    2.10; and</li>
                <li>fixing a bug where <code>$XDG_DATA_DIR/newsboat</code>
                    wasn’t created for first-time users, resulting in cache
                    lock failure.</li></ul></p>
            <p>Please grab <a
                    href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.10.1/newsboat-2.10.1.tar.xz">the
                    tarball</a> (<a

            <p>Yay, our first release is out! We’re continuing the Newsbeuter
                numbering, so this one is called 2.10. Grab <a
                    href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.10/newsboat-2.10.tar.xz">the
                    tarball</a> while it’s hot (and don’t forget to verify <a
                    href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.10/newsboat-2.10.tar.xz.asc">its
                    signature</a>.)</p>
            <p>Nikos Tsipinakis prodded me into implementing automatic
                migration of Newsbeuter configuration, so if you don’t have
                <code>include</code>s or scripts stored in your Newsbeuter
                directory, switching should be hassle-free for you. If any
                problems <i>do</i> come up, don’t hesitate to contact us via
                IRC, mailing list or issue tracker.</p>
            <p>Happy newsreading everyone,<br/>Alex</p>

            <p>Thanks for subscribing to our newsfeed! If you’re using
               Newsbeuter, consider switching to Newsboat right away&mdash;the
               upgrade is simple enough:
               <ul>
                   <li>move everything from ~/.newsbeuter/ to ~/.newsboat/</li>
                   <li>move everything from ~/.config/newsbeuter/ to ~/.config/newsboat/</li>
                   <li>move everything from ~/.local/share/newsbeuter/ to ~/.local/share/newsboat/</li>
              </ul>
              If Newsbeuter directories don’t exist, just skip that step and go to the next.</p>
